How to run:

-Keep Client.class, Server.class, config.properties and File to transmitt in one directory or workspace

-Run Server first using "java Server <File Name>" command. For example, if file name is Image.jpg, run "java Server Image.jpg"
(I have added an Image.jpg in the folder that can be used as the file)

-The run all clients using command "Java Client <Client name>" command. For example, "java Client c1"

-Press any key followed by enter in every client cmd to start all clients

-Original chunks of file divided by Server would be in the "Server" folder

-Every client forms a folder with 2 sub folders: "FinalFile" which contains the merged file and "chunks" contains the chunks.
